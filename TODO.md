# TODO

- Add `vars/stack/drupal/` files or update playbooks if a different path is expected.
- Expand per-role documentation with example variables and task flows.
- Add a quickstart for provisioning a new host from scratch.
- Document backup/restore storage retention and cleanup policy.
- Add a checklist for production rollouts (vault, DNS, monitoring, backups).
